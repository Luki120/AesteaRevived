## Disclaimer

*  The tweak, with the purpose of being FOSS and lightweight, only colorizes the *connectivity* toggles, it does not colorize the CC modules nor does the tweak contain any themes you may see in the screenshot.

## Contributing

* Contributions are more than welcomed, but should follow this etiquette:
* Push small commits (e.g if you changed 2 directories, commit one directory, then commit the other directory and only THEN push)
* Keep commit titles short and then explain them in comments.
* If you're a contributor with write access to this repository, you **should NOT** push to main branch, preferably push to a new branch and *then* create the PR.
